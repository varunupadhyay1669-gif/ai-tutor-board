# Notes + Screenshots → PDF

A tiny local web app to combine:

- **HTML notes** (generated by an LLM from your transcript), and
- **class screenshots** (handwritten work from your session)

…into one clean document you can **Save as PDF**.

## How it works

1. Paste your notes as **HTML**
2. Upload screenshots
3. For each screenshot, pick the **section** (it uses your HTML headings: `h1`–`h6`)
4. Preview
5. Click **Print / Save PDF**

## Run it

### Option A (simplest)

Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome recommended).

### Option B (recommended)

Some browsers behave better when served from a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Tips

- Ask your LLM to structure notes with headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, …). That makes it easy to insert screenshots in the right place.
- If a screenshot is in HEIC and doesn’t render, convert it to PNG/JPG first.

# Transcript Intelligence Dashboard (prototype)

This repo also contains a **local-only Transcript Intelligence Dashboard** that turns tutoring transcripts into **longitudinal** student growth data:

- Student Profile + Long-Term Goals
- Topic Map with mastery/confidence scores
- Mental block detection (repeat patterns across sessions)
- Progress timeline + recommended next targets
- Tutor view + Parent view (minimal, readable)

## Run

```bash
python3 -m transcript_intel.server --port 5179
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5179`.

The SQLite DB is created at `transcript_intel/data/dashboard.sqlite3` by default (override with `--db` or `TRANSCRIPT_INTEL_DB`).

## Tests (Playwright)

Playwright is used for end-to-end testing, but it must be installed locally:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r transcript_intel/requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m playwright install
pytest -q
```
